                <h3><i>A YouGov America poll shows that younger respondents are more likely to have absolute faith in Johnny Depp’s testimony.</i></h3>

                    The contentious <a href="https://time.com/6184072/johnny-depp-amber-heard-trial-appeal/" target="_blank">defamation trial</a> between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard that unfolded in a Virginia court over six weeks has captured a huge
                    audience - both men and women, young and old. 
                </p>

                    Many might have presumed that more men are on Captain Sparrow’s side while more women are backing Princess Mera. But that is not the case going
                    by a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/05/23/amber-heard-and-johnny-depp-trial-yougov-poll-may-" target="_blank">YouGov poll</a> with 1,000 American citizens in late May. 
                </p>
                
                 <p>
                    Male and female respondents share a similar take when asked who they think is telling the truth. Out of those who believe that only Depp is                           telling the truth, 29 per cent are men and 28 per cent are women. And of those who stand by Heard, 7 per cent are men and 4 per cent are women.

                  On the other hand, there is a marked difference in their views on the ex-couple’s credibility across different age groups. Among the youngest                         respondents aged 18 to 29, 52 per cent of them have absolute faith in Depp’s testimony. This percentage fell to 12 per cent among the oldest                         respondents who are above 65 years old.

                  <p>
                  In addition, the older the respondents, the more likely they would say that neither is telling the truth, or they are not sure. 
                  </p>
                
                  <p>
                  The YouGov poll also shows a clear win for Depp in terms of likeability, especially among the youngest respondents. A good 42 per cent of them said
                  they have a very favorable opinion of Depp, while only 3 per cent have a very unfavorable opinion of the Pirates of Caribbean star.

                 <p>
                 </p>
                 <p>
                 On the other hand, among the oldest respondents, only 6 per cent are super fans of Depp, while 20 per cent show a clear dislike for the actor. 
                 </p>
                
                 <p>
                 The anti-Heard sentiment is also most pronounced among the youngest respondents, with half of them saying they have a very unfavorable opinion of                    the Aquaman actress. Among the oldest respondents, 27 per cent of them have a very unfavorable view of Heard, but an even higher proportion of them
                 (41 per cent) say they “don’t know”. 
                 </p>
                
                
                <iframe title="How Likeable is Amber Heard?" aria-label="Grouped Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-JT2DL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/JT2DL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

                <p>
                The overwhelming support that Depp receives from young respondents is a compelling phenomenon that deserves attention. The 59-year-old actor is known for an illustrious career spanning almost 4 decades, but has largely fallen from grace over a string of behavioral failings that were well documented in publications like <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/johnny-depp-a-star-crisis-insane-story-his-missing-millions-1001513/" target="_blank">Hollywood Reporter</a>, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/the-trouble-with-johnny-depp-666010/" target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a>, as well as during the 2020 <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-54779430" target="_blank">UK libel trial</a>, in which he sued News Group Newspaper over a headline that labeled him a “wife beater”. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
Yet, a clear majority of young respondents find Depp likeable and credible. Is it because they grew up with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and are still deeply in love with the eccentric captain? Or is it because they have not read about any unflattering coverage of Depp in mainstream news? 
                </p>
                
                <p>
This is a question that cannot be answered by the YouGov findings, as respondents were not asked to indicate their source of news. But according to the <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2022/young-audiences-news-media" target="_blank">latest Digital News Report</a> by the Reuters Institute, social media networks have replaced news websites as a primary source of news for social natives aged 18 to 24. This is observed across 12 countries, including the US.
                </p>
                
                <p>
It is also notable that the use of TikTok for news has risen fivefold among social natives, from 3 per cent in 2020 to 15 per cent in 2022.  
                </p>
                
                <p>
The memefication of the televised defamation trial is rampant on social networks like TikTok, thanks in large part to the readily available courtroom footage. Sensationalized commentaries and unfounded allegations can spread quickly, while nuances in the testimonies get buried beneath trending tunes.  
                </p>
                
                <p>
The correlation between young respondents’ news source and who they see as hero and villain cannot be ascertained without relevant data at this point in time. But it certainly pays to be mindful of the impact that social media discourse can have on real-world public opinion and jury’s decision.
